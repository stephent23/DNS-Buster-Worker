# Testing Cloudflare Workers
A very small project to test the automated deployment and use of cloudflare workers. 

This just enables someone visiting the worker to supply a domain and DNS record type which the worker then queries against the Cloudflare DNS and responds with the JSON output. Nothing interesting or innovative, just a small experiment on using Cloudflare Workers.
